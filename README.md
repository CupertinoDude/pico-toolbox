pico-toolbox and ultimate tool for PICO processes and providers
========================================================================

Formely MS DrawBridge research project, evolved to real use in Windows 10,
Everybody wonders how does the Linux for Windows works.... PICO process
+ PICO provider is the answer.

This repository will record my research attempts in field of PICO
processes. So don't blame me for anything here doesn't function,
internal implementation of PP is changing build to build,
so nothing here can be considered as stable.


Structure:
==============
Each directory includes one tool or POC of tool, each tool has its 
own readme.md


Tools included:
===============


GetProcessName - this is simple tool which gets list of process names
                 and their respecive PIDs, currently the only way how 
		 to get correct name of PICO process.





Tools to build it and test it:
=============================
- Visual Studio 2015 
- Windows 10 Entrprise edition Insider build 14390
- WinDbg recommended
